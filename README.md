Prototype server and client for the malware (all credits to https://github.com/yuv-c/server_client_websocket_chat)

To run this application install the requirements on a virtual environment and run `python ccserver.py`. Then, on another tab run `python malware_client.py`. if running on MacOS yo u will need to give permission to take screenshots of your computer.

todos/errors:

function 'take_sc_snaps' doesnt send the screenshot. The format is most likely the issue however it has not worked to encode it to base64 or send it as bytes.
